abstract="The fast emergent and continuously evolving areas of the Semantic Web and Knowledge Management make the incorporation of ontology engineering tasks in knowledge-empowered organizations and in the World Wide Web more than necessary. In such environments, the development and evolution of ontologies must be seen as a dynamic process that has to be supported through the entire ontology life cycle, resulting to living ontologies. The aim of this paper is to present the Human-Centered Ontology Engineering Methodology (HCOME) for the development and evaluation of living ontologies in the context of communities of knowledge workers. The methodology aims to empower knowledge workers to continuously manage their formal conceptualizations in their day-to-day activities and shape their information space by being actively involved in the ontology life cycle. The paper also demonstrates the Human Centered ONtology Engineering Environment, HCONE, which can effectively support this methodology.",

    ABSTRACT="This project aims to propose a methodology for authoring of extra content that can be embedded in videos, or presented synchronously with them. The methodology will be based on three pillars: Human Computation, Crowdsourcing and Production Templates. It will also be developed a supportive environment for the extra content production process that will ensure that the methodology is followed, allowing the authors to focus exclusively on the activities that re- ally demand human intelligence. In this environment, will be available a set of authoring tools that can be used, and further modified if necessary. In addition, a classification proposal will be presented to the extra content for videos, according to three dimensions: Purpose, Nature and Type. Based on these characteristics the production models will be designed, and will be created a templates library that can be used to configure the supporting environment and the very process of authorship. The proposal methodology will be called ExCAM (Extra Content Authoring Methodology) and the supportive environment will be called ExCAME (Extra Content Authoring Methodology Environment).",

Videos are becoming an increasingly popular medium for communicating information, especially for online education. Recent efforts by organizations like Coursera, edX, Udacity and Khan Academy have produced thousands of educationÂ¬Â¬Â¬al videos with hundreds of millions of views in their attempt to make high quality teaching available to the masses. As a medium, videos are time-consuming to produce and cannot be easily modified after release. As a result, errors or problems with legibility are common. While text-based information platforms like Wikipedia have benefitted enormously from crowdsourced contributions for the creation and improvement of content, the various limitations of video hinder the collaborative editing and improvement of educational videos. To address this issue, we present VidWiki, an online platform that enables students to iteratively improve the presentation quality and content of educational videos. Through the platform, users can improve the legibility of handwriting, correct errors, or translate text in videos by overlaying typeset content such as text, shapes, equations, or images. We conducted a small user study in which 13 novice users annotated and revised Khan Academy videos. Our results suggest that with only a small investment of time on the part of viewers, it may be possible to make meaningful improvements in online educational videos.

A web-based video annotation system for crowdsourcing surveillance videos

abstract = {
Video surveillance systems are of a great value to prevent threats and identify/investigate criminal activities. Manual analysis of a huge amount of video data from several cameras over a long period of time often becomes impracticable. The use of automatic detection methods can be challenging when the video contains many objects with complex motion and occlusions. Crowdsourcing has been proposed as an effective method for utilizing human intelligence to perform several tasks. Our system provides a platform for the annotation of surveillance video in an organized and controlled way. One can monitor a surveillance system using a set of tools such as training modules, roles and labels, task management. This system can be used in a real-time streaming mode to detect any potential threats or as an investigative tool to analyze past events. Annotators can annotate video contents assigned to them for suspicious activity or criminal acts. First responders are then able to view the collective annotations and receive email alerts about a newly reported incident. They can also keep track of the annotatorsâ training performance, manage their activities and reward their success. By providing this system, the process of video analysis is made more efficient.
